## ðŸš€ How to Use (via Remix IDE)

1. Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Clone this repo or paste individual `.sol` files into Remix
3. Compile the contract using **Solidity compiler**
4. Deploy using **JavaScript VM**, **Injected Web3**, or **Ganache**
5. Interact with deployed contracts via the Remix interface
